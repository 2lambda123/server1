- About
	POF means PHP OpenTibia Framework. It has been built to turn easy tasks like creating an AAC (Automatic Account Creator) from scratch.
	Since in OpenTibia we need to be focused in the server, the server administrator doesn't have to waste time creating a website without 
	any vulnerabilities and bugs, so that is where POF enters in.
	
	What makes POF special is the fact that we work with the newest standards from the market. Examples of that are the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
	and some ideas retired from Ruby On Rails witch is a success in all over the world. The objective isn't to make a complete AAC but to provide 
	a good way of doing it without worrying with sanitization issues.
